# Unscramble Computer Science Problems: Investigating Texts and Calls
Reference: <i class="icon-cog"></i> **[Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/nd256)**

## About
This project contains five tasks based on a sampled set of calls and texts exchanged during september 2016.
I used python to analyze and answer questions about the text and calls contained in the dataset. Finally, I performed a runtime analysis of my solution in order to determine the efficiency.
